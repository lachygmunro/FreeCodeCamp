# FreeCodeCamp

10/10/2021 - LM

Creating individual files of completed FreeCodeCamp exercises in order to develop my understanding of version control commands and to continue to become comfortable using the command line/git/github while I learn all about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I will also use this as a resource of notes to review as I continue my learning, and a record of my progress in my career change journey.
